# Analysis-and-Modeling-with-Linear-and-Logistic-Regression
### Description
This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks focused on linear and logistic regression techniques from scratch. These notebooks explore model training, evaluation, and specific strategies to handle imbalanced datasets. The project highlights key steps and considerations when working with these models.

### Files in the Repository
1. **Linear_Regression.ipynb**
   - **Title**: Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
   - **Description**:
     - This notebook demonstrates the implementation of linear regression using gradient descent.
     - It explains the mathematical intuition.
     - Provides code for training and evaluating the model.

2. **Logistic_Regression_without_oversampling.ipynb**
   - **Title**: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression (without Oversampling)
   - **Description**:
     - Implements logistic regression on an imbalanced dataset without any balancing techniques.
     - Serves as a baseline for understanding the effect of oversampling.

3. **Logistic_Regression_with_oversampling.ipynb**
   - **Title**: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression (with Oversampling)
   - **Description**:
     - Addresses the challenges of imbalanced datasets.
     - Applies oversampling techniques to balance the dataset.
     - Trains and evaluates a logistic regression model on the balanced dataset.
     - Compares results with the original imbalanced dataset.

### Acknowledgments
This repository was developed as part of an exercise to understand linear and logistic regression modeling techniques from scratch. It includes gradient descent implementation and dataset balancing strategies for better comprehension of machine learning fundamentals.
